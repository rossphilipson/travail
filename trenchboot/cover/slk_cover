x86: Trenchboot secure late launch Linux kernel support

The basic idea of the Trenchboot project is to allow a Linux kernel to be
directly "late launched" establising a Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement
(DRTM). The late launch will be initiated by boot loader with assocaited
support added to it, for example the first capable target will be GRUB2.
The process of establishing a DRTM involves measuring everything
that is intended to be run (kernel image, initrd, etc) and everything that
will configure that kernel to run (command line, boot params, etc) into
specific PCRs in the TPM. Another key aspect is the late launch is rooted
in hardware. On Intel this is done using TXT and on AMD it is done using
SKINIT. Information on these technologies can be readily found online.

To make a kernel able to be launched from TXT or SKINIT, a stub must be built
into the setup section of the compressed kernel to handle the sepcific state
that the late launch process leaves the BSP in. This is a lot like the EFI stub
that is found in the same area. Also this stub must measure everything that is
going to be used as early as possible. This stub code and subsequent code must
also deal with the specific state that the late launch leaves the APs in.

A quick note on terminology. The open source project itself is called
Trenchboot which is hosted on Github (links below). The technology is
referred to as "Secure Launch" within the kernel code. So the prefixes
sl_/SL_ or slaunch/SLAUNCH will be seen in the code. The stub code discussed
above is referred to as the SL stub.

The basic flow is:

 - Entry from the late launch jumps to the SL stub
 - SL stub fixes up the world on the BSP
 - For TXT, SL stub wakes the APs, fixes up their worlds
 - For TXT, APs are left waiting in a pause/jmp loop for an NMI to wake them
 - SL stub jumps to startup_32
 - Kernel boot proceeds normally
 - During early setup, SL code runs to finish some validation and setup tasks
 - The SMP bringup code is modified to wake the APs
 - Kernel boot finishes booting normally

This is an initial internal posting of the kernel support patches for
Trenchboot. The code is functional using TXT and will boot to user mode
following a secure late launch. A few things to note:

 - There are still bits and pieces missing, specifically in patch 6 (further
   validation, memory reservation, etc).
 - We are focusing on Intel TXT first per OCI's wishes so some of the AMD bits
   are not implemented yet though others are.
 - Patch 1 will change once we hammer out the final details of the boot
   protocol and changes to the boot params with the x86 maintainers.

We wanted to get this code out for review once it was working. Anyway, please
have a look.
