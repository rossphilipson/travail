Locality:

The best way to think of locality is that it is like privilege levels (like
rings) with 4 being the highest. In general:

Locality 0 is the SRTM locality using PCRs 0 - 15.
Localities 1 - 4 are the DRTM localities using PCRs 17 - 22.

For the DRTM localities:

4 - This is the HW locality where only the CPU/Chipset can access the TPM at
    this locality.
3 - This locality is left as implementation specific. TXT uses it for the
    MLE's locality.
2 - Dynamically Launched OS (Dynamic OS) “runtime” environment.
1 - An environment for use by the Dynamic OS.

Table 4 in the spec above is a bit cryptic but what is important are columns
7 - 9. Column 9 indicates which locality can extend what. For the DRTM
localities:

4 - Can extend 17 and 18.
3 - Can extend 17 through 20.
2 - Can extend 17 through 22.
1 - Can only extend 20.

The other colunns have to do with what localities can reset which PCRs. Note
that only re-establishing the DRTM can reset all the DRTM PCRs.

Special PCRs:

16 - Debug PCR that can be used in any locality.
23 - PCR that can be used in any locality for any purpose.
